# FinancialTransactionTracker

Fiscal transactions personal tracker made by Jeremy Louie for the Treasury Chair of Stuart Hall High School
May - December 2023 under the guidance of Thien Chau and the International Baccalaureate Computer Science Curriculum

Built with: Java, HTML, Java Swing, and XChart

HowTo: Install all files into IDE or use .Jar file with Java. Run the program to set a password, then use the program freely for single or recurring events with available buying, selling, depositing, and withdrawing types. The user has additional information inputs for date, type, amount, and notes. After submitting one transaction, a separate index view of all tracked transactions allows for an easy view of all data with ascending or descending buttons for specific types, e., x., amount in high to low or data from farthest to closest. Additonal adjusting data charts compare dates to amounts in the simplified graphics.

Advantages: Data is encoded locally on the system using a key based on the user password. GUI resembles a checkbook format for easy inputting.

NeedTos: Implement further safety for protecting the stored data on personal computer. Add additional functionality for more graphs and the ability to delete any transactions. Streamline password creation to prevent file-read errors in edge cases. Add more transversal buttons to navigate between windows on the fly. Add a secured page to update old password with new one, given that old password was properly inputted.
